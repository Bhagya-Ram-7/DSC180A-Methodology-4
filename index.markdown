**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** //
I really enjoyed interviewing my peers to learn about their concerns surrounding gen AI. Creating a test to audit an algorithm was especially eye-opening: it helped me see how different models behave and how bias can appear in their outputs.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** //
I would like to study how AI applications are currently being used in the treatment of mental health. While they are being largely adopted to take over administrative tasks, I'm curious to understand if they might unintentionally utilize sensitive patient information (race, occupation, etc.) in ways that reinforce biases. 

This topic really interests me, but I’d also be open to investigating similar concerns about AI in other fields.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Our Quarter 1 project will likely focus on interviewing a licensed professional counselor associate about her concerns with AI in mental health. We will then design an algorithmic audit based on those concerns. We're building a patient-style message which serves as the prompt fed to several models. We will then study whether the patient demographics make a difference when triaging the severity of messages. 

A potential change to this apporach could involve including human evaluators, to compare their triage scoring with AI's. This would help validate the scores and assess bias and discrimination better.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in experimenting with AI agents that could feed prompts into multiple models and storing responses. A secondary agent could analyze model outputs to detect evidence of biased scoring. At the same time, we could have a human-in-the-loop run parallel descriptive analysis on the model outputs to validate the conclusions of the secondary agent. We would be simultaneously building and validating an intelligent testing system.
